This project is an Arduino based clock with an LCD display which can be configured via serial commands from Processing. Over wired connection or Xbee. This allows the time to be set once and then the unit can be moved anywhere as long as power is present. The LCD is a standard HD4470 compatible display and the pins are described in the Arduino code.
